THE PROOF THAT PYTHON IS EVIL

Everyone that uses python quickly arrives to the conclusion that it is 
evil. This time I've got a proof.

Anyone doing numerics should have learn first how to solve the advection 
equation,

u_t + v* u_x=0

wich is like the square root of the wave equation in the sense that it 
propagates the initial profile only in one dirrection.

When doing finite differences, one finds that the "forward-euler" method
is unstable, developing exponential growth on high frequency modes.

Files included:

feuler.f90
Solver for a gaussian profile

advec.py
the same code rewritten in python


the output is easily displayed in ygraph or xgraph


Analysis:

feuler.f90 blows as predicted, but python code may run undefinitly, the 
propagation speed doesn't match, and eventualy when the pulse reaches the 
boundary it gets reflected and propagates in the forbidden direction.

This is enough to proof the evilness of python
